/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for LearnVerse.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles, courses, and problems,
 * and a membership-based model for submissions and sessions. This means that users can only
 * read and write their own data, while submissions and sessions are accessible to those who
 * have membership based on the stored user ID fields.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/courses/{courseId}: Stores courses created by a specific user (mentor). Only the mentor can create, read, update, and delete courses under their user ID.
 * - /users/{userId}/problems/{problemId}: Stores problems created by a specific user (mentor). Only the mentor can create, read, update, and delete problems under their user ID.
 * - /submissions/{submissionId}: Stores user submissions for coding problems. Anyone can create submissions.
 * - /sessions/{sessionId}: Stores mentorship sessions between a mentor and a student.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled.
 * - All write operations are strictly controlled and require authentication.
 * - Data validation is limited to relational integrity checks (e.g., creatorId matches the authenticated user's ID).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The rules leverage the `userId`, `mentorId`, and `studentId` fields within the documents to make authorization decisions.
 * - Courses and Problems are nested under the user's document to simplify ownership checks.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-specific data (profiles, courses, problems) is segregated under the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring that only the user has access to their data.
